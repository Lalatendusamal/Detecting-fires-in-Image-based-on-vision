# Detecting-fires-in-Image-based-on-vision
INTRODUCTION
Fire accidents pose a serious threat to industries, crowded events, social gatherings, and densely populated areas that are observed across India. These kinds of incidents may cause damage to property, environment, and pose a threat to human and animal life. According to the recent National Risk Survey Report , Fire stood at the third position overtaking corruption, terrorism, and insurgency thus posing a significant risk to our country’s economy and citizens. The recent forest-fires in Australia reminded the world, the destructive capability of fire and the impending ecological disaster, by claiming millions of lives resulting in billions of dollars in damage.
 
OBJECTIVES
	Detect fire while they are still small and have not grown too large.
	Develop a low-cost fire detection system in real time
	Develop a fire detection technique in real time.
 
Methodology
	As a new fire detection technology, image fire detection has recently played a crucial role in reducing fire losses by alarming users early through early fire detection. Image fire detection is based on an algorithmic analysis of images.
	However, there is a lower accuracy, delayed detection, and a large amount of computation in common detection algorithms including manually and machine automatically extracting image features.
	Therefore, novel image fire detection algorithms based on the advanced object detection, So we are using CNN and Some Machine Learning Approaches.
	A comparison of the proposed and current algorithms reveals that the accuracy of fire detection algorithms based on object detection CNNs is higher than other algorithms.
