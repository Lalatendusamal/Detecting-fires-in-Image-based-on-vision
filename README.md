# Detecting-fires-in-Image-based-on-vision
#INTRODUCTION:
Fire accidents pose a serious threat to industries, crowded events, social gatherings, and densely populated areas that are observed across India. These kinds of incidents may cause damage to property, environment, and pose a threat to human and animal life. According to the recent National Risk Survey Report , Fire stood at the third position overtaking corruption, terrorism, and insurgency thus posing a significant risk to our countryâ€™s economy and citizens. The recent forest-fires in Australia reminded the world, the destructive capability of fire and the impending ecological disaster, by claiming millions of lives resulting in billions of dollars in damage.
 
#OBJECTIVES:
-	Detect fire while they are still small and have not grown too large.
-	Develop a low-cost fire detection system in real time
-	Develop a fire detection technique in real time.
 
#Methodology:
-As a new fire detection technology, image fire detection has recently played a crucial role in reducing fire losses by alarming users early through early fire detection. Image fire detection is based on an algorithmic analysis of images.
-	However, there is a lower accuracy, delayed detection, and a large amount of computation in common detection algorithms including manually and machine automatically extracting image features.
-	Therefore, novel image fire detection algorithms based on the advanced object detection, So we are using CNN and Some Machine Learning Approaches.
-	A comparison of the proposed and current algorithms reveals that the accuracy of fire detection algorithms based on object detection CNNs is higher than other algorithms.

#About Project Works
Importing the libraries which are required for this project: We need to install the Requirement Libraries.
1.	Numpy
2.	Pandas
3.	Matplotlib
4.	Seaborn
5.	Plotly
6.	TensorFlow

#Pre-Processing of data:
Image acquisition is the first step in image	processing.

-This	step	is	also	known	as	preprocessing	in	image processing.
-	It involves retrieving the image from a source, usually a software-based source.

Shuffling the training Data:

-	Shuffling means reordering or rearranging the data. We can shuffle the rows in the data frame by using sample () function.
-	First we import the matplotlib library , after that import random and used random shuffle function inside this put new data.
